# ElmUltimateTicTacToe

A simple Elm implementation of [Ultimate Tic Tac Toe](http://maspri.github.io/).

How to play:

The goal is to win three games of Tic Tac Toe in a row. The first player can play
in any of the small boards. From then on the small board a player must use is determined by
the previous move of the opponent. When you have to play in a board that is already decided, you can choose freely.
A good explanation can be found [here](http://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/06/16/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/).
